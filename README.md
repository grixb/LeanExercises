# Lean Exercises

Hi, in this repo, I'm practicing Lean 4 and publishing my solutions for the exercises in the lean tutorials.

I would like to proceed in the following order:
- [ ] [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/)  
  1. [x] Introduction (no exercises)
  2. [x] Dependent Type Theory (no exercises)
  3. [x] Propositions and Proofs
  4. [x] Quantifiers and Equality
  5. [ ] Tactics
  6. [ ] Interacting with Lean (no exercises) 
  7. [ ] Inductive Types
  8. [ ] Induction and Recursion
  9. [ ] Structures and Records (no exercises)
  10. [ ] Type Classes (no exercises)
  11. [ ] The Conversion Tactic Mode
  12. [ ] Axioms and Computation

I try to solve all the tasks by myself. Where this did not work out, I will indicate it in a separate comment.

I also want to go through it from a functional point of view:
- [ ] [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/)

Also, if my time and energy allow, then:
- [ ] [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/index.html)
